# ChessGame
This is a small game application that was developed in **2021** in collaboration with Justin Hanna, Charlie Li, and Mo Lin Li. It was created using VS Code, Java, and Swing. As the name suggests, it is a faithful recreation of the classic game, Chess.  The application is fully functional, albeit with some shortcuts. The game also features a working leaderboard.
